There are 3 value types num, str, bul 
We declare them by writing the value type ' ' name of variable ' ' value
for example ` num a 5, num abc 7, str string Hovsep, bul boolean 1, etc.
for if statement we write ete ' ' some operation for example a>abc , a > 10 , a < 5 , etc.
and in the last line we write end after if code  for example `
ete a>b
a=a+1
prt a
end
for while statement we write for ' ' again some operation then starting with next line we write our code and again end in the last line after while statement.
and print statement we write as prt then ' ' and name of variable for example` prt string or prt a.
